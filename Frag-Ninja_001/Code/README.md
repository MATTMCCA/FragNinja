# Frag-Ninja

**Frag-Ninja** uses an ARM Cortex-M0+ SAM D21E from Microchip.

As lady luck would have it, there is Arduino core support for this chip. 

The provided code is written in C++, using Arduino libraries, see source headers for details.

### Notes

*I **HAVE** tested the code on the Frag-Ninja boards.*

#### HID GamePad Source Code
- Frag-Ninja_DPAD_8POS
- Frag-Ninja_JOYSTICK

#### HID Keyboard Source Code
- Frag-Ninja_KEYBOARD

## Why Arduino?
Because the hardware support is there, and its popular. OH! and the *OpenSource thing* helps too.
